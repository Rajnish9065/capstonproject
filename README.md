# capstonproject
Summary of the Project
This capstone project presents a browser-based Virtual Assistant designed to help users perform daily tasks through both voice and chat commands. The assistant is entirely frontend-based and developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it remains lightweight and accessible across devices without requiring backend support.
The assistant can perform various actions such as:
•	Telling the current time
•	Opening websites
•	Responding with voice output
•	Fetching real-time weather updates and news headlines using external APIs
The core of its voice interactivity is powered by the Web Speech API, which enables both speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities.
This project showcases a practical application of modern web technologies to create an interactive and responsive user experience. It serves as a lightweight productivity tool that could be further extended to handle more complex tasks in the future.
